# Intelligent Agent powered by Artificial Intelligence

This agent is designed to navigate the Web (Web 2.0), intelligently process information and execute some actions in the automous mode.

Its functionalities include:

Information Harvesting: The agent is capable of autonomously collecting relevant data from various sources on the Web.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): It performs processing on the acquired information to extract named entities and other concepts using natural language processing techniques.

Ontology Integration: The agent integrates extracted information with established ontologies such as SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), OWL (Web Ontology Language), and other relevant ontologies.

Relationship Building: Using the integrated ontologies, the agent builds relationships between extracted concepts, enhancing the semantic understanding of the collected information.

In summary, it's a sophisticated agent that combines web harvesting, natural language processing, and ontology-based semantic modeling to extract meaningful concepts and relationships from the Web. This type of agent is valuable for knowledge discovery, semantic annotation, and building a structured representation of information for further analysis or use in intelligent systems.
